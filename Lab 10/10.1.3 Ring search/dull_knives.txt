I’m holding my breath, holding so tight
Nothing is wrong, nothing is right
I’m in the dark, looking for light
Won’t someone please save my life
Inside I’m a mess, but I don’t let it show
Just hanging on, but you’d never know
I smile all day and cry through the night
Won’t someone please save my
Life is fleeting

Dull knives, taking my life
A slow burn fire, from the inside
Dull knives, twisting my spine
And taking their time, time
‘Til I lose my mind

A smoldering flame, deep in my heart
Barely a sight, it’s barely a spark
Holding on through every night
Won’t someone please save my life
I’m crying for help, it’s such a cliché
Invisible pain, it’s filling each day
I open my mouth and feed you a lie
Won’t someone please save
My life is fleeting, no repeating

Dull knives, taking my life
A slow burn fire from the inside
Dull knives, twisting my spine
And taking their time, time
‘Till I lose my mind

Dull knives ripping from the inside
Spare me the ride
From the inside
Dull knives, twisting my spine
And taking their time, time
‘Till I lose my mind
Dull knives
