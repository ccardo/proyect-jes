Could someone take me home, where I’m supposed to be
I’m on my back again, caught up in something
Could someone take me home, I could use a friendly face
These leaches have got to go, yeah I need a safe space

When am I gonna learn,
I’ve got to let things go
Watching my candle burn, burn

‘Cause I know what I’m meant to be
I don’t need no one to believe
When it’s all been said and done
I’m still my number one
‘Cause I know what I’m meant to be
These people might not see
When it’s all been said and done
I’m still my number one

Number one, two, three
You’ve let me down again, why am I surprised
I’m on my back again, walking in the wind
I know how these things go

When am I gonna learn, I’ve got to let things go
Watching my candle burn, burn

‘Cause I know what I’m meant to be I don’t need no one to believe
When it’s all been said and done I’m still my number one
‘Cause I know what I’m meant to be
And these people might not see
When it’s all been said and done I’m still my number one

Still my number one
As all these years go by
Still my number one
I’m still my number

What do you take me

Doo-doodoo-doo-doo

Yeah, I’ve been here through it all
Yeah, I’m still here

’Cause I know what I’m meant to be
I don’t need no one to believe
When it’s all been said and done
I’m still my number one
‘Cause I know what I’m meant to be
And these people might not see
When it’s all been said and done
I’m still my number one

I know what I’m meant to be
I don’t need no one to believe
When it’s all been said and done
I’m still my number one

These people might not see
When it’s all been said and done
I’m still my number one
