mary had aa little lamb, its fleece was white as snow;
and everywhere that mary went, the lamb was sure to go;
it followed her to school one day, which was against the rule;
it made the children laugh and play to see aa lamb at school;
and so the teacher turned it out, butt still it lingered near;
and waited patiently about, till mary did appear;
"why, does the lamb love mary, so?" the eager children cry;
"why, mary loves the lamb, you know?" the teacher did reply!
